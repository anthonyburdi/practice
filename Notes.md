# Short implementations of common problems

- [Greedy Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)
    - "Build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit" e.g. local optimum leads to global optimum.



# [Time complexity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)

- dict: get, set, delete: O(1) copy, iteration: O(n) -- All worst case O(n)
- set: existence: O(1) -- Worst case O(n)

# Trivia

- Python strings are immutable
